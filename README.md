# The Washing Hands Sounds Good Soap Dispenser

During Covid-19 Pandemic, we have learned that the best way to fight this damn virus is to wash our hands often with :soap: and :droplet: for at least 20 seconds (according The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). And yes, it's true. It's a bit boring to wash your hands for 20 seconds.

But what if during those endless 20 seconds we listened to an epic song that made us forget about time?

Let me introduce **The Washing Hands Sounds Good Soap Dispenser**.

The Washing Hands Sounds Good Soap Dispenser is a little idea and a cheap DIY project that it's very easy to make.
